        <h1>Alienation of the Symbol from the Myth: The Case of Jobs in the False Myth of Spontaneous Enlightenment</h1>

        <p>This article analyzes a specific case of symbolic alienation — the transformation of Steve Jobs’ real-life image into a pseudo-myth about “mad genius and spontaneous enlightenment.” It illustrates how cultural figures are detached from their biographical roots and reinserted into manipulative ideological frameworks.</p>

        <h2>1. The Original Symbol: Steve Jobs as a Technocratic Visionary</h2>
        <p>Steve Jobs was obsessed with control, minimalism, stability, and precision. He demanded perfection down to invisible hardware details. He opposed chaos, improvisation, and open-source ideals. Jobs was not a mystic — he was a technocrat and perfectionist. His genius lay in coordination and discipline, not transcendence.</p>

        <h2>2. Manipulative Alienation: Detaching the Symbol from Biographical Truth</h2>
        <p>In the first stage of manipulation, the real biography is stripped away. The manipulator highlights superficial fragments — meditation, Zen, intuition — but omits the fact that Jobs used these as concentration techniques, not as a spiritual cult. The famous Apple “Think Different” slogan is extracted from its marketing context and turned into a supposed personal credo.</p>

        <p>Thus, the historical figure dissolves, leaving behind a decontextualized symbol ready for ideological reprogramming.</p>

        <h2>3. Insertion into a False Myth: Rewriting Meaning</h2>
        <p>The next step is embedding this detached symbol into a new ideological frame — the myth of the “mad visionary” who reaches truth by shutting down reason and embracing chaos. Jobs is presented as a shamanic prophet rather than a rational designer. His authoritarian discipline is replaced with pseudo-spiritual spontaneity.</p>

        <p>Madness becomes sanctified as “creativity.” Rationality becomes “limitation.” The result is a complete inversion of meaning — the triumph of anti-logic dressed as inspiration.</p>

        <h2>4. Implanting the Pseudo-Myth into the Audience</h2>
        <p>Finally, the manipulator implants this symbolic construct into the audience’s consciousness. The mechanism targets emotional vulnerabilities:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Love for technology</strong> — by using an admired tech figure as bait.</li>
          <li><strong>Intellectual pride</strong> — by suggesting that “only the truly advanced” reject logic.</li>
          <li><strong>Anti-mainstream sentiment</strong> — by opposing “rational dullness” with “creative madness.”</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The result: a new archetype of the “inspired fool” — a person who rejects discipline in favor of “flow” and “cosmic insight.” The manipulator gains the ability to steer this person’s thinking, emotions, and choices by redefining reason as a barrier.</p>

        <h2>5. Conclusion: The Danger of Symbolic Rewriting</h2>
        <p>The case of Jobs is not an exception — it’s a model of modern ideological control. A familiar cultural symbol is detached from truth, repackaged, and weaponized to promote anti-rational ideologies disguised as inspiration. It is not reverence for Steve Jobs — it’s exploitation of his image for manipulation.</p>

        <p>Critical thinking and symbolic literacy are the only effective antidotes. The mind that can trace meaning back to its source cannot be captured by artificial myths.</p>
