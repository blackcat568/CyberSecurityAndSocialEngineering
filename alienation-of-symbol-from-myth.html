        <h1>Alienation of the Symbol from the Myth</h1>

        <p>The alienation of a symbol from its myth, with the goal of embedding it into a manipulative pseudo-myth and using it to provoke predictable reactions in the target — that is the essence of symbolic control.</p>

        <p>Let’s break this down step by step.</p>

        <p><strong>1.</strong> Imagine there is a myth, and one of its expressions is the image of its main hero — the <em>symbol</em>.</p>

        <p>What does the manipulator do in this schema?</p>

        <p>First, they identify the symbol to which the target is emotionally sensitive. Suppose it is Christ (as an example only — without any intent to offend anyone’s faith). The manipulator finds the symbolic “trigger.”</p>

        <p><strong>2.</strong> Next, the manipulator <em>alienates</em> the symbol from the myth behind it.</p>

        <p>This refers not to institutional religion, but to the person’s <em>inner myth</em> — their lived spiritual experience: prayers, ethics, suffering, and redemption. The manipulator severs that connection and turns the sacred image into a mere object.</p>

        <p>For the manipulator, it becomes just “Object #132, Symbol #21 — ‘Christ.’” A lever that can elicit an emotional, automatic reaction.</p>

        <p><strong>3.</strong> But random triggering produces chaos. The manipulator needs control — a predictable pattern.</p>

        <p>To achieve that, they construct a <em>pseudo-myth</em> around the symbol — partly borrowing from the genuine myth, but contaminating it with parasitic manipulative elements.</p>

        <p>Example: “You speak of Christ? He said the prodigal son must return to the father. I am your father — return to me.” In truth, the manipulator distorts the meaning to reassert control, weaponizing the symbol of love and forgiveness.</p>

        <p>Thus, the symbol remains familiar — but its soul is gone. It’s enclosed in a dead, synthetic shell — the manipulative pseudo-myth.</p>

        <p><strong>4.</strong> The goal is to implant that pseudo-myth into the target’s consciousness so that they mistake it for their own truth.</p>

        <p>The “self/other” recognition mechanism is exploited: “This is my symbol — therefore, the narrative attached to it must also be mine.” Once this link forms, the manipulation succeeds.</p>

        <p><strong>5.</strong> Expected reaction:</p>

        <p>The target enacts the behavioral pattern prescribed by the pseudo-myth, while the manipulator observes, adjusts, and refines the method. Sometimes the goal is to cause emotional harm — other times, to test influence or obedience.</p>

        <p>The same technique can also invert meaning — inserting a beloved symbol into a degrading narrative to cause pain, or a hated one into a glorifying context to provoke disgust. The essence remains: the pseudo-myth replaces the genuine inner myth.</p>

        <p>But the scheme has an Achilles’ heel.</p>

        <p>It only works on those who lack authentic experience — those who haven’t lived through depth, struggle, and meaning. A person who has truly suffered, reflected, and grown — carries within a compass, a living myth that can’t be replaced by a synthetic one.</p>

        <p>Such a person will see the difference between the living and the dead, between real light and artificial glow, between love and simulation. The manipulator breaks against a heart that has known real courage, sacrifice, and self-awareness.</p>

        <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Live fully. Do not flee from pain. Reflect on every step. There is no such thing as “trauma” — only experience, and the way you process it. When you process it honestly, it becomes wisdom; when you don’t, it festers as a wound.</p>

        <p>The manipulator’s “voodoo doll” is nothing but a symbolic model of vulnerabilities. The antidote to it is the fullness of lived experience — authenticity. You cannot counterfeit the first true kiss of faith, hope, and love.</p>

        <p>The less you live by borrowed myths, the less anyone can program your reactions. Strength and light are not born from the absence of pain — but from an honest gaze into it.</p>
