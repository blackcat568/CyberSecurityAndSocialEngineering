<h1>Alienation of the Symbol from the Myth for the Purpose of Introducing the Symbol into a Manipulative Pseudomyth</h1>

<p>Alienation of the symbol from the myth for the purpose of introducing the symbol into a manipulative pseudomyth and using it to influence the bearer — to achieve a predictable reaction.</p>

<p>Yes, I understand it sounds intricate. Let's break it down point by point.</p>

<h2>1. Selection of the Symbol</h2>

<p>Imagine there is a certain myth, and its expression — let's say — is the image of the main hero of this myth. Let's call it a "symbol".</p>

<p>What does the manipulator do in this manipulative scheme of logic?</p>

<p>First of all — they identify the symbol to which the victim is sensitive. Identified. Let it be Christ, for example (taking the symbol purely for example; children of Allah, don't be offended — may His name be glorified forever!).</p>

<h2>2. Alienation of the Symbol from the Myth</h2>

<p>Next, the manipulator alienates the symbol from the myth that stands behind it.</p>

<p>Important: we are not talking so much about the church myth, not about the history of Christianity as such, but about the individual spiritual experience of the victim associated with the veneration of this symbol. That is, in this context, the myth is the genuine personal experience of faith, spiritual experiences, prayers, following ethics, tragedies and victories that the person went through with Christ in their heart.</p>

<p>But the manipulator takes this symbol and, fundamentally, not with a sincere desire to understand what it means to the person, but — with a desire to turn it into a tool. The symbol is alienated from the myth. The little man of Semitic appearance, painted on a board, is torn away from the tears of repentance and the happiness of the feat of self-sacrifice.</p>

<p>For the manipulator, this is — just a symbol from the database: "Object No. 132, symbol No. 21 'Christ'". This is a thread, pulling which can achieve an emotional, spontaneous reaction.</p>

<h2>3. Introduction of the Pseudomyth</h2>

<p>If you just arbitrarily pull the thread — it won't work. The reaction may be strong, but it will be unpredictable and uncontrollable. And the manipulator's goal is control. Or, at the very least — testing and refining control technology.</p>

<p>Therefore, the manipulator builds a pseudomyth around the symbol. Partly — based on the real myth (what is known to them about Christianity, about the victim's spiritual history). But along with that — they introduce manipulative, parasitic elements. For example:</p>

<blockquote>"What, Christ? — Oh yes, we honor Christ. And he said: the prodigal son must repent and return to his father. So, I am your father. Return to me."</blockquote>

<p>Although in essence we are not talking about the repentance of the prodigal son, but about a victim who realized they were being used and started sending the manipulator to three cheerful letters (thanks to Saints Cyril and Methodius for inventing these letters).</p>

<p>That is: the symbol — seems the same, but cut off from the genuine context. Clothed in a dead, synthetic pseudomyth, saturated with hidden influence.</p>

<h2>4. Introduction into the Victim's Consciousness</h2>

<p>The main thing is to introduce this pseudomyth into the victim's consciousness so that they perceive it as their own.</p>

<p>The mechanism of "friend/foe" by symbol is exploited — a key point of their meaning system.</p>

<p>The victim must react: "Oh, this is my symbol — so the myth behind it is mine too."</p>

<p>That's it. The client is ready.</p>

<h2>5. Expected Reaction</h2>

<p>The victim enacts a behavioral act according to the introduced scheme.<br>
The manipulator — observes, records, adjusts.</p>

<p>This basic scheme can be modified — for example, to cause a negative reaction:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Introducing a dear-to-heart symbol into a discrediting myth — to cause pain.</li>
  <li>Introducing a hated symbol into a glorifying pseudomyth — to cause disgust and disappointment.</li>
</ul>

<p>But the essence remains the same: the victim accepts the pseudomyth as genuine, and it begins to displace, substitute, or deform their real internal myth.</p>

<h2>6. The Achilles' Heel of the Scheme</h2>

<p>It works only against those who have no genuine experience, no path traveled, no deeply experienced personal meanings. A person who has not undergone initiation through suffering, pain, feat — cannot distinguish a fake from the real, because they have no standard.</p>

<p>And if there is experience?</p>

<p>If there is — sooner or later the manipulation fails. The person will see: before them is not someone trying to understand, but someone playing, pressing buttons, pulling strings, processing them as an algorithm.</p>

<p>Genuine experience will compare the living with the dead and see the falsehood. Will see that before them is not fire, but a light bulb. Not love, but an emulation. Not light, but a shop window.</p>

<p>The manipulator breaks against a heart that has accomplished a feat. And not once.</p>

<p>A genuine feat. Sincere. Accomplished.<br>
Such a heart — will be vigilant.</p>

<p>The deeper your real experience, the more honestly you have comprehended it (with mind, with pain, and without running away from yourself) — the more resilient you are. More resilient to those who build a diagram of your soul to poke it with needles.</p>

<h2>7. The Voodoo Doll Metaphor</h2>

<p>The manipulator — is like a Voodoo sorcerer: makes a doll to control.</p>

<p>And if anyone thinks that Voodoo is superstition, then in vain. This is — a metaphor for logic. The doll — is a model. A symbolic scheme of vulnerabilities.</p>

<h2>8. Conclusion</h2>

<p>Live a full life.<br>
Live without running away from pain.<br>
Live, comprehending every step.</p>

<p>There is no such thing as "trauma". There is experience. And there is how you work with it.</p>

<p>If you know how to work — it's experience. If you don't know how — it's trauma.</p>

<p>It's impossible to fake the first initiation kiss on the cheek. The one that was done with faith, hope, and love.</p>

<p>And if the whole life is "played around — ran away", without genuine experience, then yes: the manipulator will do whatever they want with you.</p>

<p>So — do not be afraid of even the most terrible. Live through it. Comprehend it. Squeeze all the lessons out of it. This will be your armor. Your shield.</p>

<p>Strength and light are given not by the absence of pain, but by an honest look at it.</p>
