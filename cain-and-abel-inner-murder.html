        <h1>Cain and Abel: Inner Murder and the Birth of Independence</h1>

        <p>In the biblical narrative, Cain and Abel appear not merely as brothers but as archetypal figures — symbols of two masculine destinies. Abel is the “good boy,” obedient, humble, pleasing to the Higher Power and its laws. Cain is the rebel, the one who rejects order, yet through this rebellion discovers the painful path of separation and independence.</p>

        <p>In modern male psychology, Abel represents the “Nice Guy” pattern described by Robert Glover: kind, polite, conflict-averse, constantly seeking approval — especially from the figure of the Great Father, the patriarchal authority, spiritual mentor, or leader. His sense of worth is entirely dependent on external validation. For Abel, the highest goal is to be accepted, recognized, and blessed. He follows rules not because he chose them, but because “that’s how it should be.”</p>

        <p>But this model has a dark side. A life spent waiting for approval breeds dependence. Such a man cannot act without permission, fears confrontation, and avoids decisive choices. As long as Abel lives within him, he is doomed to remain an obedient son — even at forty, fifty, or seventy.</p>

        <p>Cain, on the other hand, symbolizes the initiated man — the one who has severed ties with the archetype of the Great Father. His killing of Abel is not an endorsement of violence but a psychological metaphor: the rejection of childish submission and of the illusion that external authority must grant meaning. Cain stops waiting to be “initiated” and instead becomes the author of his own destiny.</p>

        <p>The inner killing of Abel is a painful process. It demands the destruction of comforting illusions — that the world is fair, that authority is always right, that recognition guarantees worth. A man who dares this act renounces the soft captivity of obedience and faces the world directly, without safety nets.</p>

        <p>But in a culture without true rites of initiation — where maturity is often replaced by military absurdity, careerism, or mystical delusion — the passage from Abel to Cain becomes especially difficult. Society offers false substitutes: aggression without responsibility, manipulation instead of honesty, performative strength without inner backbone. Many men remain stuck between these poles — no longer boys, but not yet free adults.</p>

        <p>The killing of inner Abel does not mean losing kindness or compassion. It means abandoning their infantile form — the one built on fear of losing love and approval. After his inner act, Cain does not become a beast but a self-sufficient man. He can say “no” when necessary and “yes” when he truly means it, even if it contradicts the majority.</p>

        <p>The initiated Cain does not seek conflict for its own sake. He simply understands that to live only by others’ rules is to never discover who you really are. His maturity is built on responsibility, not permission; on the ability to withstand pressure, not to hide behind others; on honesty with himself, not conformity to the world.</p>

        <p>Thus, the archetypal story of the brothers becomes not about an external murder but an inner transition: from Abel — dependent and obedient, to Cain — free and responsible. And this path, however frightening it may seem, remains the only road to authentic masculine maturity.</p>
