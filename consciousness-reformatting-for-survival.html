        <h1>Consciousness Reformatting for Survival in Critical Conditions: Specifics and Consequences</h1>

        <p>Let us suppose that normal personality development, adapted to social norms, corresponds to <strong>Structure A</strong>.</p>

        <p>A person lives and develops according to Structure A — healthy, stable, and adaptive.</p>

        <p>Then suddenly a misfortune appears in their life — insignificant at first, but destabilizing.</p>

        <p>Life turns into hell.</p>

        <p><strong>What does consciousness do?</strong></p>

        <p>It activates a protective mechanism.</p>

        <h2>Stage 1</h2>
        <p>The transition from normal conditions to hell requires a new, temporarily stable structure — call it <strong>Structure B</strong>.</p>

        <p>Structure B at this stage is temporary, unstable and incomplete; it is relevant only during the crisis period, while Structure A is frozen “until better times.”</p>

        <p>When the hell ends, the organism simply deconstructs Structure B, and everything related to it is perceived as a terrible dream. Gradually a person returns to standard social behavior.</p>

        <p>Psychologists in such cases say: “We understand how hard it was for you, but you have a normal life, normal friends, a normal cat… you’ve returned to normal.”</p>

        <h2>What if better times do not come?</h2>

        <h2>Stage 2</h2>
        <p>Hell intensifies, and the organism invests resources to develop and stabilize Structure B.</p>

        <p>Structure B becomes less ephemeral, more defined, worked out and functional, though still secondary. Structure A remains dominant.</p>

        <p>If the crisis ends at this point, we get a person with a combined structure — call it <strong>Ab</strong> — a soldier who has partially remained at war.</p>

        <p>This is the so-called “traumatized personality.” Such people give a strange impression — the organism left Structure A dominant, but Structure B was not fully deconstructed and remains embedded.</p>

        <p>This is a sentence: to live with inclusions of Structure B for the rest of one’s life. Overall behavior is normal but with a set of atypical traits and customs.</p>

        <h2>Stage 3</h2>
        <p>The hell does not end but intensifies. Then truly interesting processes occur.</p>

        <p>The organism asks: why keep Structure A dominant and support Structure B as auxiliary if the hell never ends?</p>

        <p>Adapting to critical conditions, consciousness transforms:</p>
        <p>Structure B, which stabilized consciousness during the crisis, becomes dominant, and Structure A becomes auxiliary (in case the hell ever ends).</p>

        <p>We obtain structure <strong>aB</strong> (B dominant with A secondary).</p>

        <h2>Stage 4</h2>
        <p>The hell continues indefinitely.</p>

        <p>The organism receives persistent input — the hell is endless. Supporting Structure A, even as secondary, is a waste of resources that could be directed to strengthening Structure B.</p>

        <p>Putting aside occult nonsense, the psyche is a pragmatic and rational mechanism that reallocates resources efficiently unless a person sabotages themselves through foolish choices.</p>

        <p>And then the most interesting thing happens — the organism deconstructs Structure A.</p>

        <p>That is the end: Structure A is erased. We obtain a pure Structure B.</p>

        <p>The organism becomes fully adapted to life in hell; adaptive mechanisms for normal life are reduced as unnecessary.</p>

        <p>However, the system now cannot function without regular stress. The hormonal system ceases to produce joy hormones in normal amounts; instead, during stress Structure B produces them in excess, providing euphoria. From outside behavior may seem odd, but for the bearer of Structure B it is normal.</p>

        <p>Structure B is entirely dependent on stress — it cannot operate without it. Fortunately (from the organism’s perverse perspective), the hell persists and Structure B ticks on like a clock.</p>

        <h2>Stage 5</h2>
        <p>Fate is ironic. Even after disillusionment in light, goodness and humanity, the hell may weaken — a clearing appears.</p>

        <p>Structure A is reduced; Structure B cannot function without stress.</p>

        <p>The organism does not deconstruct Structure B nor restore Structure A, because it has been repeatedly shown that Structure B is an effective life-keeper.</p>

        <p>What then?</p>

        <p>Either the person loses sanity and creates uncontrolled hell — “strike, cut, destroy.” Or they find partners with whom to reproducibly and controllably recreate hellish conditions — people like them.</p>

        <p>An organism based on Structure B that receives regular stress continues functioning and begins to rebuild Structure A — but not the authentic A, rather a simulation <strong>(a)</strong> — a façade to appear normal among others and avoid standing out.</p>

        <p>People around cannot easily distinguish (a)B from Ab. An angel hiding black wings under a cloak is taken for an eccentric loner — “someone with quirks.”</p>

        <h2>On Acceptance and Guidance</h2>
        <p>If you experience such changes — do not be afraid, but also do not suppress or abruptly interrupt the process. Be courageous enough to manage it clearly and correctly so it may complete without side effects or tragic consequences. Do not deny the warrior’s path that fate has assigned you — go to the end and accept yourself as you are.</p>

        <p class="warning">Note: if you or someone near you experiences severe psychological distress, dissociation, self-harm urges, or dangerous behaviors, seek professional help immediately. These processes can be complex and potentially harmful; clinical supervision from qualified mental health professionals is strongly recommended.</p>
