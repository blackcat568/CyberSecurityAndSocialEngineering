  <h1>From Science to Worldview: Logic as a Foundation Against Delusion</h1>

  <p>In an age of information overload and the decline of critical thinking, there is an increasing need to revisit the foundation of human worldview. One of the key movements in this reexamination is the transition from <strong>science to conscious worldview</strong> — a path where empirically verified knowledge becomes the basis for a holistic and resilient perception of reality.</p>

  <h2>Logic as the Basis of Order</h2>
  <p>At the core of a stable worldview lies the understanding that nothing in the world arises “by itself.” This principle — shared by both Western scientific tradition and Eastern philosophy (for instance, the Buddhist law of karma) — states: every effect has its cause, and every action produces a result. Wheat sown will not yield oats; an unperformed act brings emptiness or, at best, chaos.</p>

  <p>This is not a metaphysical assumption — it is confirmed in every scientific experiment. Mechanics, chemistry, biology — all rest on the law of causality. Therefore, human thought that aims to reflect reality adequately must also be rooted in it.</p>

  <h2>Intuitive Insight: Revelation or Imagination?</h2>
  <p>The opposite of this approach is the exaltation of “intuitive insight,” often given the status of revelation in pseudo-spiritual circles. Yet a rational mind must ask: is it truly revelation? If so, from where — the divine, the unconscious, a repressed affect, or perhaps an external manipulator?</p>

  <p>The Christian canon is cautious here: only Scripture is acknowledged as true revelation. Everything else — as the Church Fathers warned — is either reasoned judgment or a <em>delusion</em>, born of pride, illness, or deception.</p>

  <h2>The Illusion of Bohemian Gnosis</h2>
  <p>Particularly dangerous is “intuitive enlightenment” in circles lacking fundamental scientific education, where a bohemian lifestyle — with alcohol, drugs, and eclectic mysticism — replaces discipline. In such an environment, there is no mechanism for verifying insight, no distinction between experience and illusion, inspiration and psychosis.</p>

  <p>In these cases, intuition becomes a path not to freedom, but to tragedy — personal and collective. “Revelations” without a rational base may lead to destructive behavior, alienation, and psychological collapse. History abounds with examples where unchecked insight led to disaster — especially when tied to messianic or violent fantasies.</p>

  <h2>Manipulation Disguised as Revelation</h2>
  <p>The danger multiplies under external manipulation. When an individual becomes the target of psychological influence — where symbolic triggers are studied and exploited — “intuitive insight” becomes a <strong>trap</strong>. It is not a message from the transcendent, but a control mechanism, where the illusion of revelation replaces critical judgment.</p>

  <p>The seductive slogan “turn off your mind and trust your heart” is not wisdom — it is a method of disarming reason. The puppet mistakes its strings for wings.</p>

  <h2>Case Study: Charles Manson — “Revelation” and Murder</h2>
  <p><strong>Charles Manson</strong>, the cult leader whose “revelation” led to the brutal murders of 1969, built a manipulative ideology blending racism, apocalyptic mysticism, and delusional messianism. Under his influence, followers committed multiple killings — including that of actress Sharon Tate and her friends. Manson’s “insight” was a toxic fusion of paranoia, illusion, and control.</p>

  <p>This case shows how “revelation” detached from logic and ethics devolves into psychosis — especially within cult dynamics fueled by charisma and fear.</p>

  <h2>Case Study: Anatoly Moskvin — The Madness of “Preservation”</h2>
  <p><strong>Anatoly Moskvin</strong>, a Russian linguist arrested in 2011, exhumed and mummified the bodies of deceased children, keeping them as “dolls.” He claimed a desire to “preserve life.” His case — horrifying and tragic — reveals how delusion, cloaked as insight, can become pathology. The inability to distinguish empathy from obsession, or reverence from horror, marks the collapse of rational boundaries.</p>

  <h2>Conclusion: From Science to Conscious Awareness</h2>
  <p>The path toward a mature worldview is not rejection of intuition, but its <strong>integration through logic and discipline</strong>. Even in Eastern traditions like Zen, enlightenment arises not from spontaneous flashes, but from long training and structured paradoxes (koans). True revelation requires preparation — a mind capable of discernment and clarity.</p>

  <p>From science to worldview — this is not the denial of reason, but its spiritual extension. Rationality becomes the hygiene of consciousness. Only a mature mind can tell intuition: “I hear you, but I will verify.”</p>

  <p>Otherwise, every “insight” risks becoming not illumination, but the beginning of tragedy.</p>
