<h1>From Science to World Awareness: Logic as a Foundation Against Delusions</h1>

  <p>In conditions of modern information overload and a crisis of critical thinking, the need to reconsider the foundation of the human worldview arises more and more often. One of the key directions of such revision becomes the movement from science to world awareness — a path on which empirically verified knowledge becomes the basis for a holistic and stable perception of the world.</p>

  <h2>Logic as the Foundation of World Order</h2>
  <p>One of the cornerstones of a stable worldview is the recognition that in the world, nothing arises "by itself." This principle, lying at the foundation of both Western scientific tradition and Eastern philosophy — for example, the Buddhist law of karma — states: every effect has its cause, and every action generates a certain result. Sown wheat yields wheat, not oats. An unperformed action leads to emptiness, or, at best, to the chaotic sprouting of weeds.</p>

  <p>This proposition is not a metaphysical assumption — it is confirmed in every experiment, in every field of science. Mechanics, chemistry, biology — all rest on the law of causality, and thus human thought, claiming to adequately reflect reality, must be rooted in it.</p>

  <h2>Intuitive Insight: Revelation or Play of Imagination?</h2>
  <p>The opposite of such an approach becomes the idea of intuitive insight, endowed in quasi-spiritual circles with the status of revelation. However, a reasonable person striving for clarity must ask themselves several questions: is this truly a revelation? If yes — then from where does it originate: from a deity, from personal unconscious, from repressed affect, or from an external manipulator?</p>

  <p>The Christian tradition is cautious on this issue. The canon states that the only recognized "revelation" is Scripture. Everything else — is either the result of reasonable judgment, or, as the Church Fathers emphasized, the fruit of "prelest" (spiritual delusion), i.e., self-deception caused by pride, illness, or external evil.</p>

  <h2>The Illusions of Bohemian Gnosis</h2>
  <p>Particularly dangerous is "intuitive insight" in an environment where basic education in the exact sciences is absent, a bohemian lifestyle involving alcohol and psychoactive substances is practiced, and the source of "wisdom" becomes syncretic systems mixing occultism, sectarianism, and street esotericism. In such an environment, there is no mechanism for verifying the authenticity of the received "revelations," and, even more importantly, the ability to distinguish experience from illusion, inspiration from psychosis, is absent.</p>

  <p>In this case, "intuitive insight" — is not a path to freedom, but to tragedy, both personal and collective. It can become a gateway to destructive behavior, breaking connections with loved ones, substituting common sense, and even leading to mental disorders.</p>

  <p>Experiments with "revelations," especially in combination with sectarian practices, sleep deprivation, refusal of adequate nutrition, use of consciousness-altering substances — this is a path not to enlightenment, but to mental exhaustion and disorders. History knows many examples where insights without foundation became a catastrophe not only for the "enlightened one" themselves but also for their loved ones. Particularly dangerous are cases where such "insights" include ideas of messianism, violence, or exclusivity.</p>

  <h2>Manipulation Under the Mask of Insight</h2>
  <p>The situation becomes more complicated under conditions of external manipulation. If a person finds themselves in the field of influence of a manipulator who studies their sensitivity to certain symbols and consciously introduces them into the informational space with the aim of eliciting a predictable reaction — then "intuitive insight" becomes a trap. This is not contact with the transcendent, but a form of control in which a person is made to believe they are "having an insight," while they are merely blindly following someone else's script.</p>

  <p>The call to "turn off your mind and trust your heart" in such a context — is not metaphysical wisdom, but a way to make the victim turn off critical thinking. Thus, the puppet begins to consider its movements acts of freedom.</p>

  <h2>Charles Manson: "Insight" and Mass Murders in a Cult Group</h2>
  <p>Charles Manson — a cult leader whose "insight" and ideology led to a series of brutal murders in 1969 in the USA. Manson created the cult group "Manson Family," where he positioned himself as a messiah possessing the highest truth. His "insight" combined racist, apocalyptic, and mystical ideas, according to which he predicted a racial war and claimed that only his followers would be saved.</p>

  <p>Under Manson's influence, group members committed a number of murders, including the murder of actress Sharon Tate and her friends — eight people died in total. This "insight" was far from a scientific or ethical foundation — it was the fruit of paranoia, illusions, and manipulations.</p>

  <h2>Anatoly Moskvin - "Insight" and Mummification of Minors' Corpses</h2>
  <p>Anatoly Moskvin — a Russian historian and linguist, who was arrested in 2011 for shocking crimes. He stole the bodies of deceased girls and turned them into mummified dolls, which he kept in his home. Moskvin explained his actions by a desire to "return" life to the children, preserving them in an ideal state. His actions caused deep public resonance and raised the question of the boundaries of madness and "insight" that can lead to tragedy. Subsequently, Moskvin was found insane and sent for compulsory treatment. This case is a clear example of how a distorted perception of reality under the guise of "intuitive understanding" can lead to catastrophic consequences.</p>

  <h2>Conclusion: From Science to Sustainable World Awareness</h2>
  <p>The correct path to forming a mature, stable worldview is the movement from science to conscious world understanding. Even in Eastern practices like Zen or Dzogchen, oriented towards sudden insight, enlightenment is achieved through strict discipline, the formal logic of koans, and years of practice. It is not an arbitrary flash, but the result of a profound order.</p>

  <p>True insight is possible only if it relies on a prepared consciousness, capable of distinguishing, critically evaluating, and maintaining internal clarity. World awareness, grown from the scientific picture of the world, allows not abandoning intuition, but integrating it as part of a broader system of understanding.</p>

  <p>The path from science to world awareness — is not a rejection of reason for the sake of feelings, but endowing reason with the function of spiritual hygiene. In this lies genuine maturity. Because only a mature mind is able to say to intuition: "I hear you, but I will check."</p>

  <p>Otherwise, any "revelation" risks becoming not an illumination, but the beginning of a tragedy.</p>
