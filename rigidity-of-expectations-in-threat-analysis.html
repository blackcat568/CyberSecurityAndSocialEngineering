<h2>Rigidity of Expectations in Threat Analysis</h2>

<h3>or why, while the “cat is sleeping,” the “mice” are already feasting inside the system</h3>

<p>In recent years, the world has become significantly more unstable, and the overall level of risk—both physical and digital—has noticeably increased. This is especially true for the field of cybersecurity: cyberspace provides an attacker with unique advantages—distance, anonymity, a low barrier to entry, and the ability to inflict significant damage with minimal resource expenditure, often completely evading legal responsibility.</p>

<p>Against this backdrop, a systemic problem is increasingly evident, one that is characteristic of both ordinary users and professionals alike: <strong>rigidity of expectations in threat analysis</strong>.</p>

<hr>

<h2>What rigidity of expectations is</h2>

<p>The essence of the problem is simple and therefore especially dangerous. A person tends to expect that an attacker will act in <strong>clear, familiar, and visually obvious ways</strong>. In everyday imagination, it looks roughly like this: at night someone saws through a lock with a hacksaw, squeezes out a window, climbs inside—in short, behaves as loudly, crudely, and conspicuously as possible.</p>

<p>However, this very approach <strong>directly contradicts the logic of an experienced adversary’s actions</strong>—whether that adversary is a professional cybercriminal, an organized group, or a structure abusing its authority.</p>

<p>A rational attacker does not choose obvious and expected scenarios, because they are deprived of effectiveness in advance.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Why “standard” attacks are a sign of amateurism</h2>

<p>Expecting template-based attacks works only against:</p>

<ul>
  <li>amateurs,</li>
  <li>petty hooligans,</li>
  <li>impulsive and inadequate subjects,</li>
  <li>people acting emotionally and without strategy.</li>
</ul>

<p>Against an experienced adversary, this approach does not work in principle.</p>

<p>A professional strives to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>leave no obvious traces,</li>
  <li>act indirectly,</li>
  <li>use third parties,</li>
  <li>apply complex and non-standard schemes,</li>
  <li>avoid direct attacks that are easy to detect and document.</li>
</ul>

<p>That is precisely why the most dangerous attacks often look <strong>like “nothing is happening”</strong>.</p>

<hr>

<h2>An analogy from the offline world (for clarity)</h2>

<p>An experienced thief does not saw through a lock or squeeze out a window. He invites you to dinner. There, he treats you to food laced with a sleeping agent, while beforehand taking a substance that blocks its effect on himself, and demonstratively tasting the food, convincing you that it is safe.</p>

<p>When you fall asleep, he calmly takes your keys, wallet, credit cards—and leaves.</p>

<p>In the morning you wake up. Everything is in place. And it may take you quite a long time to realize that you have already become a victim of a crime.</p>

<p>In cybersecurity, this scenario occurs far more often than “broken windows.”</p>

<hr>

<h2>How this looks in infrastructure</h2>

<p>A provider may be under an attacker’s control for <strong>years</strong>. At the same time, its system administrators may not even suspect the fact of compromise, expecting that a “real hack” must necessarily manifest itself through server crashes, service failures, and red warning lights.</p>

<p>They fail to take into account that modern attack tools are designed for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>maximum stealth,</li>
  <li>minimal interference with system operation,</li>
  <li>disguise as background noise.</li>
</ul>

<p>Anomalies are written off as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>bots,</li>
  <li>spikes in user load,</li>
  <li>“hardware glitches,”</li>
  <li>software imperfections.</li>
</ul>

<p>Meanwhile, the on-duty administrator is playing a computer game, and the attacker has long since bypassed the defenses and is methodically expanding control over users’ systems. Grotesque? Yes. Rare? Not at all.</p>

<hr>

<h2>The user as a “well-fed cat”</h2>

<p>With users, the situation is even more illustrative. A classic tragicomedy:</p>

<ul>
  <li>pirated Windows from dubious sources,</li>
  <li>a router without a password,</li>
  <li>passwords of the <code>qwerty123456</code> variety (fortunately, modern services already try to protect users from them),</li>
  <li>a complete absence of a threat model.</li>
</ul>

<p>And at the same time, a firm conviction:<br>
“Nothing will happen to me. And if something does happen, I’ll notice it immediately and quickly block everything.”</p>

<p>In practice, such a user resembles a well-fed cat on whose body the mice are already carrying on their personal lives, while it enjoys a deep sleep.</p>

<hr>

<h2>What to do about it</h2>

<p>The conclusion is extremely simple:</p>

<p><strong>Avoid rigidity of thinking.</strong><br>
Do not expect attackers to act according to standard and familiar patterns.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There is a saying for a reason:</p>
<p><em>He who makes doors too strong often forgets to reinforce the walls.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>And one more old threat-modeling formula:</p>
<p><em>Fear the goat from the front, the donkey from behind, and a vile person—from all sides.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Be prepared to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>assume non-standard scenarios,</li>
  <li>take complex and combined attacks into account,</li>
  <li>analyze weak signals and indirect indicators of compromise.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>The true sign of mature thinking</h2>

<p>The ability to see and analyze <strong>non-standard, complex threats</strong> is a sign of genuinely flexible, creative, and analytical thinking. In cybersecurity, this is not an abstract virtue, but a practical condition for survival.</p>

<p>The key task is to create an environment in which an attacker simply cannot deploy activity. Wherever they try to act, they will encounter:</p>

<ul>
  <li>preventive defense mechanisms,</li>
  <li>people who think non-standardly,</li>
  <li>the absence of “sleeping cats.”</li>
</ul>

<p>This does not make a system absolutely invulnerable—but it significantly complicates the attacker’s life and noticeably simplifies the life of law-abiding users.</p>

<p>And in the world of cybersecurity, this is precisely what is considered a good result.</p>
