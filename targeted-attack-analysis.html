    <h2>Presumed Design and Application of the Complex Surveillance-Manipulation System Applied During the Targeted Attack</h2>

    <p><strong>1. Presumed Manipulation Scheme.</strong></p>

    <p><span class="number">1.1</span> The attacker, in my assumption, acts as an alpha-tester of a complex electronic-social engineering surveillance system — a mechanism of information-psychological control and monitoring.</p>

    <p><span class="number">1.2</span> For research purposes, the attacker deliberately selects a subject with a specific profile: intellectually, ethically, and emotionally developed, capable of demonstrating deep psychological and behavioral reactions. The victim is deliberately chosen among socially vulnerable individuals (without influential connections or legal resources) to minimize their ability to resist control, manipulation, and unlawful data collection. The control encompasses full access: computer, smartphone, environment (friends, relatives, colleagues, supervisors), and monitoring (as well as potential control, e.g., bribing a blogger) of media sources influencing the victim.</p>

    <p><span class="number">1.3</span> The observed subject preferably holds idealistic beliefs — trust in authorities, a desire to help others, and a wish to find sincere friends. These traits make a person more vulnerable to manipulations appealing to kindness, trust, and willingness to help. Cold-blooded pragmatists or cynical skeptics are harder to manipulate.</p>

    <p><span class="number">1.4</span> A background in humanities and strong interest in humanitarian sciences, arts, and culture is desirable. Such a profile increases susceptibility to pseudo-cultural and pseudo-philosophical manipulation techniques, disguised as mentorship, artistic creativity, or "deep" philosophy (poetry, prose, etc.).</p>

    <p><span class="number">1.5</span> Third parties recruited by the manipulator from the victim's surroundings are often convinced they are simply “earning money,” even illegally, and that they face no responsibility, since the system is designed to leave no traces suitable for prosecution.</p>

    <p><span class="number">1.5.1</span> At the same time, compromising material is pre-collected on the hired individuals — e.g., proof that they received payment for participating in illegal activities, spreading personal information, or psychological manipulations. The compromising material serves as coercion: if they refuse or attempt to leave the scheme, the manipulator threatens to report them to the police or disclose their involvement to relatives and friends, turning the participant into a psychologically and legally vulnerable figure and forcing continued cooperation.</p>

    <p><span class="number">1.5.2</span> The manipulator systematically studies and catalogs the characteristics of each recruited person: how easily they can be recruited, by which arguments they were convinced, the amount they agreed upon, how accurately and diligently they followed instructions, and the effectiveness of their impact on the end victim. Based on this data, statistics and models of the “most effective” use of third parties are developed: which persuasion, bribery, and behavioral techniques produce predictable responses in the victim.</p>

    <p class="note">Thus, those who consider themselves accomplices or “partners” of the manipulator are often equally victims — experimental subjects given the illusion of partnership or standard commercial relations (employer-contractor). They do not realize they are being used in an experimental manipulation scheme, where the primary goal is the study and exploitation of the end victim's responses.</p>

    <p><span class="number">1.6</span> The tested version of the system, in my assumption, is already applied in “live” conditions for manipulating people to achieve power and financial goals by unlawful means. Potential targets may include employees with access to confidential or secret information (including military personnel), government officials, influential media figures, and humanities scholars. Experience shows that technically trained specialists (engineers, system administrators) generally resist such operations more effectively, so they are less of a priority for attackers.</p>

    <p>The attack objectives are varied: theft of private data for later blackmail or compromise, and theft of strategically valuable information. Furthermore, the system is used for recruiting and controlling agents, who then help implement the initiators’ power and commercial objectives.</p>
